- Spring Framework is the first major release since 4.

-------------Whats new is 5-----------------.
- Core framework revision
- Core container updates
- Functional programming with Kotlin
- Testing Improvements.

-----------Spring 5 features based on java 8------------
- Efficiency increase using reflections, java 8.
- Selective declerations built on java8 default methods.
- @nullable and @Notnull to explicitly mark null variables.

JPA - Java persistence API, used for working with relational sets.
it can be used as an ORM - Object relational mapping similar to LINQ.

To convert the POJO classes into JPA entities you can use @Entity tag (javax.persistence)
The H2 (DB written in JAVA) the console is set to false by default, go in and enable it.

- If there is a mapping with a table that has to refer 2 colums from 2 tables,

You can use:
JoinTable(name = tableName, joinColums = @joinColum(name = "Col1 Name"), 
InverseJoinColumns = @joinColum(name = "Col2");

-------- Spring Data JPA-----------

- Simply put - JPA is an interface and Hibernate is the implementation.

The persistance API makes it relatively easy to switch one implementations with the other.

Spring Data repos provide an implementation of the Repo Pattern(DAO pattern)

- it is important because it allows you to substitute the persistance layer.
ie, going from SQL to NoSQL.

Bootstrap class can be used ro intialize the values in the DB.

- If auto wiring fails, make sure that you have added the @Repository tag to the classes or interfaces.

- Bean are objects that form a backbone of the application. It is an object that is
instantiated, assembled, managed by spring IoC Container.

----------- Spring MVC--------------

- Very common design pattern.

- Configure controller we use @Controller, - sets it up  to manage the class as a bean.

- When @Contorller is used, the class is detected as a spring bean and the same is added to the spring context.

- Auto wiring simply means getting an instance. done by passing that instance via the constructor.

- The data brought from the source can be displayed in a template engine (Dynamic web content), same like JSP'same
- Thyme life is a natural template engine. Better than JSP.

- When using JSP, for updating, you have to put the files into tomcat and restart for the template to take effect.
but in a natural template engine, you can directly do it, no need to redeploy.
